# AI_Learning_p1
This project is dedicated to learning and practicing AI concepts through hands-on experience with AI tools. Participants will gain practical skills in AI development using tools like TensorFlow, focusing on real-world applications and problem-solving

#TensorFlow 
is like a toolkit for teaching computers how to learn from data and make decisions. It helps programmers build smart programs that can recognize patterns in things like pictures, words, or numbers, and then make predictions or decisions based on that understanding. It's like giving a computer the ability to learn and think a bit like a human brain, but in a simplified way.
